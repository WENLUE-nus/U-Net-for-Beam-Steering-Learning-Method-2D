# 🌐 Beam-Steering Learning Method

This repository provides the **deep learning module** for imaging result refinement in the academic paper submitted to *IEEE Journal of Selected Topics in Electromagnetics, Antennas and Propagation (JSETAP)*. The approach leverages **U-Net** for enhancing coarse imaging results generated by **Inverse Scattering Problem (ISPs)** methods.

## 📄 Paper

> 🔍 The code corresponds to the deep learning component of our JSETAP submission.  
> As shown in the figure below, the proposed two-stage architecture integrates:  
> - A **local-to-global U-Net**, which stitches beam-scanned local views into a coarse global image (Fig. d), and
> - A **fusion U-Net**, which combines different ISP methods’ global reconstructions to produce the final output (Fig. e).
